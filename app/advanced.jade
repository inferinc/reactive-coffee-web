    ## Side Effects and Resource Cleanup

    Sometimes you will have side effects associated with certain `bind`s or
    components, such as establishing a connection or setting an interval timer:

    ```coffeescript
    blinkingBox = (opts) ->
      active =  rx.cell false
      setInterval (-> active.set not active.get()), opts.ms ? 500
      div {class: bind -> if active.get() then 'red-box' else 'black-box'}

    $('body').append(
      div {class: 'container'}, boxes.map -> blinkingBox()
    )
    ```

    In these cases, you'll want to do proper resource management/cleanup
    whenever the `bind` context is removed or refreshed—in this case, stopping
    the interval timer.  For these situations, you can use
    `rx.onDispose(callback)`:

    ```coffeescript
    blinkingBox = (opts) ->
      active =  rx.cell false
      interval = setInterval (-> active.set not active.get()), opts.ms ? 500
      rx.onDispose -> clearInterval(interval)
      div {class: bind -> if active.get() then 'red-box' else 'black-box'}
    ```

    ## Garbage Collection

    Dependencies hold references to their dependents in order to know who to
    propagate updates to.  We do currently unsubscribe a dependent observable
    from its dependencies whenever that dependent is refreshed, but if the
    dependent observable itself creates nested binds, those nested binds must
    also be disconnected, and so on, recursively.

    For instance, say we have:

    ```coffeescript
    showUnread = rx.cell(true)
    unread = rx.cell(0)
    div {class: 'scoreboard'}, bind -> [
      if showUnread.get()
        div {class: 'unread'}, bind -> "#{unread.get()} message(s)"
      else
        '(nothing shown)'
    ]
    ```

    Initially, `unread` has a subscriber, as expected: the inner `bind`.  When
    we update `showUnread`, the outer `bind` will re-evaluate and create a new
    inner `bind` (for the nested `div`), completely forgetting about the old
    one.  Without the nested bind cleanup, `unread` now has *two* subscribers,
    old and new inner `bind`s.  And since the old inner `bind` is still
    referenced from `unread`'s list of subscribers, it can't be
    garbage-collected.  Ergo, memory leak.

    What instead happens: `bind` tracks any nested `bind`s.  On re-evaluation,
    these inner `bind`s are _disconnected_, unsubscribing themselves from all
    their dependencies.  This disconnection also occurs recursively down to
    *their* nested `bind`s, and so on.

    One question is what happens at the top level or when you want to break out
    and do your own thing. We don't have the luxury of weak refs in JS, and as
    a result it's less forgiving if you do "silly" things like create binds
    that go nowhere and that you don't want to keep.

    (But even with weak references, one can't tell if you added a bind only to
    subscribe a console.log caller to its changes, save to localStorage, or
    some other side effect that you *do* want to keep.)

    For instance, you don't want to write the above as the following:

    ```coffeescript
    showing = false
    $('.toggle-button').click ->
      if showing
        $('.scoreboard').html(
          div {class: 'unread'}, bind -> "#{unread.get()} message(s)"
        )
      else
        $('.scoreboard').text('(nothing shown)')
      showing = not showing
    }
    ```

    The key for these situations is that `bind`s should go all the way to the
    top, or else you'll want to manually disconnect your (top-level) binds
    using their `disconnect` method:

    ```coffeescript
    showing = false
    topBind = null
    $('.toggle-button').click ->
      if showing
        $('.scoreboard').html(
          div {class: 'unread'}, topBind = bind -> "#{unread.get()} message(s)"
        )
      else
        $('.scoreboard').text('(nothing shown)')
        topBind.disconnect()
      showing = not showing
    }
    ```

    ## Mutations Inside Binds

    Say you had some dependent cell:

    ```coffeescript
    plusOne = bind -> src.get() + 1
    ```

    If you try something like the following, i.e. explicitly wire up a
    dependent cell to modify a source cell:

    ```coffeescript
    bind ->
      x = plusOne.get()
      dst.set(val)
    src.set(2)
    ```

    you'll get a warning that you're trying to perform a cell-mutating
    operation within the subgraph of a dependent cell.

    This is discouraged because a well-structured program should exhibit a
    clean DAG of dependencies.  When you do something like this, you're
    potentially creating cycles.  It also muddies what `dst` *should* reflect,
    when you have multiple bind locations calling `dst.set(...)`—it's often
    clearer to express the value of `dst` as some expression of its
    dependencies.

    Usually you'll instead want to have `dst` be a dependent cell of `plusOne`
    rather than be its own `SrcCell`:

    ```coffeescript
    dst = bind -> plusOne.get()
    ```

    However, in case you need an escape hatch in a bind (har har), you can wrap
    some mutation code in `rx.allowMutations` to suppress the warnings:

    ```coffeescript
    plusOne = bind ->
      rx.allowMutations ->
        x = src.get() + 1
        dst.set(x)
    ```

    Note that downstream `bind`s triggered by the `.set()` will not be
    considered a nested bind of the current bind context.  The two are
    considered disconnected and unrelated—otherwise you get unintuitive
    behaviors resulting from routine disposals on downstream refreshes.

    Any other nested binds inside `allowMutations` will see the warnings again
    if they attempt to mutate observables.

    Note: currently the warning is only detected in `bind` calls—you can also
    escape with manual event subscriptions:

    ```coffeescript
    src.onSet.sub ([old, val]) -> dst.set(val)
    ```

    However, you must manage your subscription, so if this is happening
    within some bind context, you must also unsubscribe on context disposal:

    ```coffeescript
    uid = src.onSet.sub ([old, val]) -> dst.set(val)
    rx.onDispose -> src.onSet.unsub(uid)
    ```
