    **Why yet another client-side framework?**

    See [Motivation and Design Rationale](design.html).

    **How does Reactive stack up against the many other client-side frameworks?**

    See [Related Work].

    **Isn't this approach just reverting back to the PHP days of mixing markup
    and logic?**

    Reactive is designed for rich application development.  Rather than focusing on
    the division between markup and logic, Reactive focuses on separating models
    from views and on the component abstraction.  Components must encapsulate not
    just markup, but also behavior.  The two should be coupled, not separated.

    This library also takes the stance that logic-less is generally a counter-productive
    endeavor---the logic-less-ness and associated gains are primarily superficial, readability can be *adversely*
    affected, and it does not separate concerns.  Others have [written][] [more][]
    on this.

    **Why jQuery / what is the relationship between Reactive Coffee and jQuery?**

    The library just uses jQuery as a cross-browser interface to the DOM for its
    own operations.  All tags are wrapped in jQuery objects.  You don't need to use
    jQuery, but jQuery excels as a cross-platform API and is probably the most
    popular of managing low-level DOM operations.  Although jQuery is known to not
    scale very well, higher-level application structure is where Reactive Coffee
    steps in.

    **Why the syntax noise in the template language?**

    This is actually not set in stone.  The framework could handle a more concise
    template syntax.  For instance, it's certainly feasible to support a language
    in which one of the above examples could be rewritten as:

    ```coffeescript
    div '.sidebar', [
      h2 'Send a message'
      form {action: '/msg', method: 'POST'}, [
        input {type: 'text', name: 'comment', placeholder: 'Your message'}
        select {name: 'recipient'}, [
          option {value: '0'}, 'John'
          option {value: '1'}, 'Jane'
        ]
      ]
    ]
    ```

    This would be closer to the concision of languages like Slim and Jade:

    ```coffeescript
    .sidebar
      h2 Send a message
      form(action='/msg' method='POST')
        input(type='text' name='comment' placeholder='Your message')
        select(name='recipient')
          option(value='0') John
          option(value='0') Jane
    ```

    However, the project currently errs on the side of more conservatively adding
    syntax to the DSL, and defaulting to strictness.

    **Why not use Knockout observables?**

    Reactive originally tried simply reusing KO, but ultimately divorced itself
    since there are both desired features that are missing (differences in array
    event propagation, topologically ordered batch propagations, etc.) and features
    that are unwanted (mis-matched programming model, larger API surface area,
    etc.).

    **Why did you choose to use `rx` as the namespace?  You know about Reactive
    Extensions, right?**

    Yes, it's cited in the list of [Related Work].  We chose `rx` because short
    namespaces are convenient and it's unlikely you're using RxJS if you're
    using reactive.coffee, but please correct us if we're wrong.

    **Do I need to sprinkle `rx.cell()` everywhere in my model?**

    You actually don't.  At one extreme, you can always fall back to just wrapping
    your entire model in a single cell, and re-render everything on changes, which
    is sufficient for small/simple applications.

    However, there are other benefits to systematically using `rx.cell()` besides
    its performance scalability, including debugging and introspection of what the
    DAG of dependencies looks like in a running application (on a finer granularity
    than "views depend on model").  Additionally, applications may want to manually
    create subscriptions to events only on parts or certain cells of the model, in
    which case referencing cells is the clearest and most direct way to do so,
    rather than needing to compute diffs on your full model.

    An in-between optimization would be to have a system that figures out the diffs
    for you (variants of which are found in other frameworks including Angular and
    React), such that at least DOM changes are localized.  For more complex
    applications, though, where you may have multiple "layers" of models and
    view-models, cells scale.  Also, in the future, we may get the best of both
    worldsâ€”take a look at `Object.observe`.  For more on these directions, see
    [Ideas](ideas.html).

    **Can I use this from JavaScript?**

    Yes, you can.  The main benefit of using CoffeeScript here is that it has a
    very DSL-friendly syntax for Reactive's declarative UIs, and particularly
    for the terse anonymous function syntax to represent the incrementally
    recomputable bindings.  Otherwise, it's pretty similar.

    It's worth showing a quick example of what that would look like:

    ```javascript
    var $sidebar = rx.bind(function() { return
      div({class: 'sidebar'}, [
        h2({}, 'Send a message'),
        form({action: '/msg', method: 'POST'}, [
          input({type: 'text', name: 'comment', placeholder: 'Your message'}),
          select({name: 'recipient'}, users.map(function (user) { return
            option({value: ""+user.id}, [user.name]);
          }))
        ])
      ])
    });
    ```
